Welcome to the AI Voice Assistant project built in Python! This project provides a foundation for creating your own voice-activated assistant using Python. Whether you want to explore voice recognition, natural language processing, or just build a fun project, this codebase is a great starting point.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** The assistant uses a voice recognition module to understand and interpret spoken commands.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Implement basic natural language processing to extract meaning from user input.
- **Customizable Commands:** Easily extend and customize the list of commands the assistant can understand and respond to.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Enable the assistant to respond to users with synthesized speech.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) library
- [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) library
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ai-voice-assistant-built-in-python.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the assistant:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the assistant by running the `main.py` script.

2. Once the assistant is listening, speak a command. For example:
   - "What's the weather today?"
   - "Tell me a joke."
   - "Open Google."

3. The assistant will process your command and respond accordingly.

## Customization

- Add or modify commands in the `commands.py` file to tailor the assistant to your preferences.
- Explore the `voice_recognition.py` and `text_to_speech.py` modules for further customization.
